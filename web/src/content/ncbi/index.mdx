### GenBank Feature Keys

Features in a GenBank file provide information about segments of the macromolecule's sequence:
  - e.g. for DNA: introns, exons
  - e.g. for proteins: active site, signal peptide,

- [`mat_peptide`](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/WebFeat/mat_peptide_s.html). mature peptide or protein coding sequence; coding sequence for the mature or final peptide or protein product **following post-translational modification**; the location does not include the stop codon (unlike the corresponding CDS).
- `Site` and `Region`. only in GenPept files, sourced from external databases.
  - `Sites` are single
